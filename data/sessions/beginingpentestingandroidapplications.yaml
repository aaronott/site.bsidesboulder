    If you are looking to get started in Penetration Testing one of the best places to get started is looking at Android applications. During the course of the talk we will talk about various location you can get files, tools that you will need for static and dynamic analysis.

    During this talk we will go over the basics of what it means to penetration test an android application covering topics such as getting access to the applications using an android device.  Android applications make for a fantastic place for people to begin application testing, in most cases all information that is provided to you by the application are all represented in high level languages, meaning a little bit of skill with a programming language and a browser with google allows you to easily understand what the code is doing.

    Static code analysis in Android is particularly easy because instead of what we look at for many application penetration tests, where we only have access to the binary file, android renders all of the information used to run the application in easy to read files.  When working with Android application because the application binary is compiled down to a byte code that is then interpreted there is the ability to get back almost the same code that went into the compile process.

    On the Dynamic Analysis side there are some clear advantages to testing android applications over other platforms.  Because of the tools that are provided with android it can make it very easy to test android applications and work with them in memory as the application is running.  Additionally because of the structure of the platform it's possible to do Dynamic analysis using both a physical device as well as a virtualized one.

    All of these factors make for a good entry point not only for new students to the evaluation of images as well as old pros looking to add another skill to their tool belt.
