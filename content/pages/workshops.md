# Elastic's Practical Threat Hunting Workshop

**Maximum number of registrants:** 30
**Duration:** 4 hours

## Overview

The wisdom of “assume breach” has never been more relevant than when we consider the role of threat hunters in proactively identifying threats. Once an attacker has obtained initial access to their target environment, they attempt to evade detection as they work towards their objectives.

Threat hunting combines the knowledge and experience of your team with technologies in your environment to create an active capability - one that assumes passive and reactive approaches are flawed, and that perpetually seeks out evidence of malicious activity. By practicing the skills and critical thinking of threat hunters, attendees will be better equipped to detect intrusions earlier and more comprehensively - preventing damage to critical systems or loss of data.

During this hands on workshop and CTF exercise, you will learn a methodology to hunt for adversary tradecraft, while using open source and free software such as the Elastic Stack, Beats, and Sysmon. You will learn the foundations of threat hunting: developing hunt hypotheses, identifying necessary data sources, performing analyses, and measuring the precision of your hunts.

We will conclude with a CTF exercise: Your organization is breached. You will receive a threat intelligence report that provides details of how a rival company was recently compromised. Your goal is to hunt for and identify evidence of the threat group's malicious behavior, you will not receive any ephemeral indicators of compromise (IOCs).

## Instructors

David French ([@threatpunter](https://twitter.com/threatpunter)) is a Security Research Engineer at Elastic, focusing on analyzing adversary behavior, developing detections, and sharing information with the security community. He formerly worked at Endgame doing applied research and led threat hunting strategy and incident response at a large financial institution. He is the co-author of The Elastic Guide to Threat Hunting.

Brent Murphy ([@brent_murphy](https://twitter.com/brent_murphy)) is a Security Research Engineer at Elastic where he creates behavioral detections for the latest emerging threats. Prior to Elastic, he served on the Advanced Threat team at a Fortune 500 Financial Institution where he jointly developed a Threat Hunting program. He is the co-author of The Elastic Guide to Threat Hunting.

Ross Wolf ([@rw_access](https://twitter.com/rw_access)) is a Security Research Engineer at Elastic where he creates solutions to detect adversary behavior in endpoint data. At Endgame (acquired by Elastic), he developed the Event Query Language and the real-time detection engine used for Reflex. Ross has additionally contributed adversary detections to the EQL Analytics Library and MITRE's Cyber Analytics Repository.

## Who should attend this workshop?

This workshop is meant for Security and IT professionals who want to develop or renew threat hunting skills and experiences that are applicable to both open source and commercial technology solutions.

## Attendee requirements

An understanding of endpoint and network fundamentals. Experience working in an IT or security operations role such as a SOC or incident response analyst is a bonus. Experience using a SIEM, knowledge of adversary tradecraft, and Kibana Query Language (KQL) is a nice-to-have, but not required.

**Please arrive 15 minutes before the workshop's start time.**
